# 60 Words About the Author
author-about: Howdy! I'm Ethan. I'm a Level 5 University of Portsmouth student, studying Computer Games Technology. My passion is learning about / creating games, as a medium of entertainment and as an experience. My joy comes from programming games, everything from gameplay features, streamline features and the arithmetic behind it all; other aspects of game development intrigue me as well. I have a keen interest in music composition / playing keyboard, I like to watch anime and read manga and I love playing story-driven single player games (especially JRPG's and Action games).
