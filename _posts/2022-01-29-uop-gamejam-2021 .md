# What is the Roger Harper Live At The Cluny?

> Roger Harper Live at the Cluny is a game created for the Portsmouth University Game jam 2021. This game jam took place over three days. The goal was to plan and create a game based upon three generated themes. This year's themes were a bizarre combination consisting of: The cricket player 'Roger Harper', A pub in Newcastle known as 'The Cluny' and Saint Marcellin Cheese. My involvement within the game was as the lead programmer. My main responsibilities involved creating the main rhythm game functionality. Due to our teams' hard work and effort, our game won an award for 'Best Use of Theme'. In an addition to this, it was also nominated as an honourable mention for 'Most Ambitious'.
