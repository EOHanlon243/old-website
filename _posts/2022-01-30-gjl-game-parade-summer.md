# What is the Day Of The Swimming Dead?

> Day of the Living Dead is a game created for the GJL Game Parade Summer 2021 game jam. The games were judged by game creators in the industry from a wide range of companies. This allowed us to gain better insight into game creation and design. This took place over two weeks, which were split between creating the base game and polishing it to improve the quality of the final product. The theme of the game jam was focused on 'One Time Use'.This was the first time I used Unreal Engine in a game jam. My involvement with the game was as the lead programmer, involved with player movement, gun mechanics and the overall gameplay loop. Although no awards were won for our game, the feedback given for our game was very helpful for future games and was overall it was a pleasure to take part.
