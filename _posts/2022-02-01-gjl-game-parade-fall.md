# What is the Titled Dog Game?

> Titled Dog Game is a game created for the GJL Game Parade Summer 2021 game jam. Like in the GJL Game Parade that took place during the summer, the games were judged by game creators in the industry. This took place just over a week, which was split between creating the game and two days to polish and implement quality of life features. The theme of the game jam was 'Leave something behind'. My involvement with the game was with UI design and puzzle mechanics and the overall gameplay loop. When the award ceremony happened, the game was a finalist for '3D Art'. The feedback was very useful in understanding flaws with our game design.
