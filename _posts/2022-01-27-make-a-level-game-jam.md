# What is the Marti's Meltdown?

> Marti's Meltdown is a game developed for the Make-A-Level Game Jam 2021. This was the first jam that I partcipated in along with my team. The theme was 'Emergency' to fit with the jame taking place around May Day. An addition restriction added was to cofine the game into a single level. The jam ran over the span of a week. Our submission was a 2.5D puzzle platformer where your objective is to unlock rooms and escape the corrupted reactor.
